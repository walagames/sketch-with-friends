# Step 6: Use a smaller base image to run the application
FROM alpine:latest

# Step 7: Set the Current Working Directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 8: Copy the Pre-built binary file from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/main .

# Step 9: Copy the words.csv file into the container
COPY words.csv .
